                <p className='Tennis_mainrightcontent'>The first tennis Grand Slam of 2024 is fast approaching. Melbourne will once again play host to the best players in the world who will battle it out to be crowned the Australian Open champion.<br></br><br></br>
                Djokovic added the French Open and US Open titles to his Grand Slam haul of 2023 and finished the year in style with further Masters 1000 titles in Cincinnati and Paris, before he also clinched the ATP Finals crown in Turin.<br></br><br></br>
                He will, however, face stiff opposition if he wants to claim a record-extending 11th Australian Open and 25th Grand Slam singles title.
It is hoped that Rafael Nadal will be in line to make his latest comeback from injury in time to feature in Melbourne, while the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner will all believe they can dethrone the Serbian.
In the women’s draw, the likes of defending champion Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and US Open champion Coco Gauff will be among the favourites, but there are potential contenders wherever you look, while British tennis fans will hope that Emma Raducanu will be fit enough to play in the tournament.
<br></br><br></br>The draw for the 2024 Australian Open has not been made but the usual suspects are likely to be in attendance.
Barring injuries, defending champion Djokovic will be joined by a who’s who of men’s tennis. Alcaraz will be keen to add the title in Australia to his 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon victories and arrest a run of two straight defeats to Djokovic, should the pair face each other in Melbourne.
Elsewhere, Medvedev, Sinner, Andrey Rublev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev, Holger Rune, Hubert Hurkacz and Taylor Fritz are among the contenders.
One of the biggest talking points ahead of the event is whether or not Nadal will return to full fitness in time to feature. The Spaniard has been out of action since last year’s Australian Open, when he was beaten in the second round by MacKenzie McDonald.
The 37-year-old had surgery on his hip in the summer and saw Djokovic surpass his tally of 22 Grand Slams.
Toni Nadal has said he expects his nephew to make his latest comeback in time to go for a third Australian Open title.</p>
