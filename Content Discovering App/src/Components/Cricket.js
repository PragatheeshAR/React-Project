                <p className='cric_mainrightcontent'>The ICC Men's T20 World Cup,[2] is the Twenty20 International cricket tournament, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2007. As of 2024 it will include 20 teams.<br></br><br></br>

The event has generally been held every two years. In May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018, with South Africa being the possible host,[3] but the ICC later dropped the idea of a 2018 edition at the conclusion of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.[4] The 2020 edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed until 2021, with the intended host changed to India. The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman[5] due to problems relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, taking place 5 years after the previous (2016) iteration.<br></br><br></br>

As of 2022, eight editions have so far been played and a total of 21 teams have competed. Only the West Indies and England have won the tournament more than once, both having won two titles. The inaugural 2007 World Twenty20, was staged in South Africa and won by India, who defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. The 2009 tournament took place in England, and was won by the previous runner-up, Pakistan, who defeated Sri Lanka in the final at Lord's. The third tournament was held in 2010, hosted by the countries making up the West Indies cricket team. England cricket team defeated Australia in the final in Barbados, which was played at Kensington Oval, winning their first international tournament. The fourth tournament, the 2012 World Twenty20, was held in Asia for the first time, with all matches played in Sri Lanka. The West Indies won the tournament by defeating Sri Lanka in the final, winning its first international tournament since the 2004 Champions Trophy.[6] The fifth tournament, the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, was hosted by Bangladesh, and was won by Sri Lanka defeating India, Sri Lanka being the first team to play in three finals. The sixth tournament, the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, was hosted by India and was won by West Indies defeating England. The seventh tournament, the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup , was hosted by UAE and was won by Australia defeating New Zealand.

England are the reigning T20 World Cup holders, having beaten Pakistan in the 2022 final, winning their second title. They became the first men's team to hold both limited-overs World Cups (T20 and ODI) simultaneously.</p>
